# Standalone CQELS Engine in Java
This under-development version is the next generation of [ prototyped CQELS engine released in 2013](https://github.com/cqels/CQELS-1.x), the next release will be CQELS version 2.0, code name, COSMO. COSMO will be released by the end of 2025 to align with the [SmartEdge](https://smart-edge.eu/) project's open source release timelike with following features :

1. Support Semantic Stream Fusion for Deep Neural Networks and RDF/Graph Streams
2. Support recommended Syntaxes of [RSP Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/) and RDF*/SPARQL*
3. Support CEP operators
4. Support Logic reasoning with RDFS/OWL and  Answerset Programming (Hermit and WASP/Clingo) 
5. Support Deep Learning for Semantic Reasoning on Vision Data (via DNN engines such as Mxnet,Tensorflow, Pytorch, OpenCV, Onnxruntime and OpenVino)
6. Support Markov Logic Network for integrating Logic reasoning with Deep Neural network models
7. Support Websocket/TCP/MQTT  for Federation on Edge Devices [Fed4Edge](https://github.com/cqels/Fed4Edge)
8. Support ARM hardwares such as Raspberry Pi, Jetson nano and Intel Movidius
9. Support Persistent stream

We are gladly now funded by DFG, BMBF and Horizon Europe, Chip-JU under five projects, [COSMO](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/453130567?language=en) and [BIFOLD](https://bifold.berlin/), [SMARTEDGE](https://smart-edge.eu/) and [AIoTwin](https://aiotwin.eu/) and [SMARTY](https://www.smarty-project.eu/))for the next 3 years.  Before that, the team was funded EU and Irish funding agencies under more than 10 projects in the last 12 years.
